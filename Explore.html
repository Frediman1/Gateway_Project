                <h1> Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary</h1>
                <p>Located just on the outskirts of Freetown, in the Western Area Peninsula National Park, Tacugama
                    Chimpanzee Sanctuary was founded in 1995 by conservationist Bala Amarasekaran and his wife Sharmila.
                    Initially established to enforce wildlife laws and rescue and rehabilitate orphaned chimpanzees,
                    Tacugama has grown into a diverse conservation organization. Caring for close to 100 chimpanzees
                    on-site, Tacugama is also actively engaged offsite in community outreach, wildlife field research,
                    environmental sustainability, conservation education and alternative livelihoods programs. Tacugama
                    is also an eco-tourism hub for Freetown – home to 6 eco-lodges, and a variety of activities for both
                    tourists and Freetowners alike to participate in. All ages and people are welcome from 9am to 5pm
                    Monday - Friday. Admission fee is 10$ per day. </p>

                <h1> Gula Rainforest National Park </h1>
                <p>Covering an area of 71,070 ha, GRNP is characterized by extensive rolling hills cloaked in evergreen
                    and semi-deciduous forest divided into three blocks – Gola North, Central and South. The park
                    comprises the largest remaining area of intact, lowland rainforest in Sierra Leone and is a
                    significant remnant of the once vast Upper Guinea Forest belt of West Africa, a global biodiversity
                    ‘hotspot’ and a priority for international conservation efforts. Botanical assessments have
                    identified close to 1,000 plant species, half of which are endemic to the Upper Guinea Forest
                    ecosystem. The forests of the GRNP have largely remained intact in spite of sporadic logging and a
                    decade of civil war during the 1990s. Regenerating secondary forest (in old logging areas) is
                    largely confined to the edges of the park with the core interior zone supporting high, primary
                    forest and abundant wildlife. Current satellite imagery shows the park as an ‘island of green’ in a
                    largely agricultural landscape, confirming that the park’s forests are continuing to be effectively
                    protected. Of the 899 species of plant that are known to occur in the park, 232 are tree species.
                    The most common family is identified as Leguminosae, with common species such as Cynometra leonensis
                    and Brachystegia leonensis. However, the most dominant tree species is Heritiera utilis
                    (Sterculiaceae) (Klop et al 2008). IUCN classification for plants is incomplete. Nonetheless, at
                    least 21 threatened species listed by IUCN have been recorded recently including one, Tieghemella
                    heckelii, that is classified as Endangered and 20 classified as Vulnerable (IUCN 2012). Poorter et
                    al. (2004) classified 278 woody plants in the Upper Guinea forests as rare or threatened based on
                    extent of distribution and threats from human exploitation. Of these, 67 have been recorded in the
                    park. The only way to travel their is through a boat, all ages and people are welcomed. Cost for the
                    boat is 30$ roundtrip and lodging is 100$ a week. </p>
